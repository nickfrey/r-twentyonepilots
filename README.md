/r/twentyonepilots CSS
===============

This repository is a version of [Naut](https://reddit.com/r/naut) customized for /r/twentyonepilots. I have also added a Grunt build system and converted the main source file to SCSS. I don't recommend using this repository as a base for your subreddit unless you are a developer.

This repository also includes specific subreddit CSS for things like flair.

## Building

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt`
3. Copy the contents of `production.min.css` into the subreddit CSS page.
